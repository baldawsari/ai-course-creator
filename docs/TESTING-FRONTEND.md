# TESTING-FRONTEND.md

Frontend testing guide and progress tracker for the AI Course Creator.

## Testing Overview

- **Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Current Status:** 14.37% coverage (as of July 14, 2025)
- **Test Files:** 14 unit/integration tests + 7 E2E tests
- **Goal:** Achieve 80% coverage across all metrics

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.tsx

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:headed          # With browser UI
npm run test:e2e:mobile          # Mobile testing
npm run test:e2e:performance     # Performance tests
npm run test:e2e:accessibility   # A11y tests
```

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests (Quick Wins)
**Goal:** Fix utility and simple component tests first

```bash
# Run each test individually:
npm test -- src/lib/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts --no-coverage
npm test -- src/lib/utils/__tests__/formatting.test.ts --no-coverage
npm test -- src/lib/utils/__tests__/analytics.test.ts --no-coverage
npm test -- src/components/ui/__tests__/button.test.tsx --no-coverage
```

### Phase 2: Shared Components
**Goal:** Fix shared component tests

```bash
npm test -- src/components/shared/__tests__/course-card.test.tsx --no-coverage
npm test -- src/components/shared/__tests__/file-uploader.test.tsx --no-coverage
```

### Phase 3: Feature Components
**Goal:** Fix feature-specific components

```bash
npm test -- src/components/features/course-builder/__tests__/generation-controls.test.tsx --no-coverage
npm test -- src/components/features/course-builder/__tests__/resource-upload.test.tsx --no-coverage
```

### Phase 4: Hooks & Integration
**Goal:** Fix hook tests and integration flows

```bash
# Hooks
npm test -- src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-api.test.tsx --no-coverage
npm test -- src/hooks/__tests__/mobile.test.ts --no-coverage

# Integration tests
npm test -- src/__tests__/integration/auth-flow.test.tsx --no-coverage
npm test -- src/__tests__/integration/course-creation-flow.test.tsx --no-coverage
```

### Phase 5: E2E Tests (Run Separately)
**Goal:** Run E2E tests after unit tests pass

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run individual E2E tests
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/course-management.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/dashboard.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/performance.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/accessibility.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/collaboration.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/exports.spec.ts
```

## Testing Best Practices

### For Unit Tests
1. Run tests individually to avoid timeouts
2. Use `--no-coverage` flag for faster execution during fixing
3. Fix one test file completely before moving to next
4. Update this tracker after each file is fixed

### For Component Tests
1. Test user interactions, not implementation
2. Use `screen.getByRole` for better accessibility
3. Mock external dependencies (API calls, etc.)
4. Test error states and edge cases

### For E2E Tests
1. Run after unit tests are stable
2. Use headed mode for debugging
3. Test critical user paths
4. Check for accessibility issues

## Common Test Fixes

### TypeError Issues
```typescript
// Add proper null checks
const element = screen.queryByRole('button')
if (element) {
  expect(element).toBeInTheDocument()
}
```

### Async Issues
```typescript
// Use waitFor for async operations
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText('Loading')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

### Mock Issues
```typescript
// Ensure mocks are properly set up
jest.mock('@/lib/api', () => ({
  fetchData: jest.fn()
}))
```
