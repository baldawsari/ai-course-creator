## Problem

The application lacks clear documentation for production deployment. Developers don't know:
- Which environment variables are required vs optional
- How to set up the database properly
- Production deployment best practices
- Security configurations needed

## Current State

- Multiple `.env.example` files exist but lack context
- No production deployment guide
- Missing database migration instructions
- No security hardening documentation

## Required Documentation

### 1. Environment Variables Guide

Create comprehensive documentation covering:

#### Required Variables
- **Supabase**: URL, anon key, service key - with setup instructions
- **AI Services**: Anthropic API key, Jina API key - with links to obtain
- **Authentication**: JWT secret generation, session configuration
- **Database**: Connection strings, migration commands

#### Optional Variables
- Email configuration for notifications
- Monitoring and error tracking
- Rate limiting customization

### 2. Database Setup Guide

- Supabase project creation walkthrough
- Required tables and RLS policies
- Migration execution commands
- Backup and restore procedures

### 3. Production Deployment Guide

#### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All required env variables set
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured

#### Deployment Options
- Docker deployment with docker-compose
- Traditional VPS deployment
- Platform-specific guides (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

### 4. Security Hardening

- Production-safe environment variables
- HTTPS configuration
- Security headers setup
- API rate limiting
- Database security best practices

## Deliverables

1. **`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide
2. **`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`** - Environment variables reference
3. **`docs/SECURITY.md`** - Security best practices
4. **Updated `.env.example`** files with detailed comments
5. **`scripts/setup-production.sh`** - Automated setup script

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Developer can deploy to production following the guide
- [ ] All environment variables are documented
- [ ] Security best practices are clear
- [ ] Common issues and solutions are covered
- [ ] Automated setup script works on fresh server

## References

- Current `.env.example` files
- Supabase documentation
- Security best practices for Node.js apps
