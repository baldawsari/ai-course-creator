## Description
Split from PR #10 to make the changes more manageable. This issue focuses on adding comprehensive test coverage for the Query client utilities module.

## Scope  
- Add tests for `src/lib/query-client.ts` utilities
- Target coverage: 60%+ (currently 25%)
- File: `src/lib/__tests__/query-client.test.ts` (~660 lines)

## Test Coverage Areas
### Core Utilities
- Cache invalidation utilities
- Prefetch utilities  
- Optimistic update utilities
- Query key factories

### Advanced Features
- Background sync and error recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Mutation error handling

## Technical Requirements
- Mock @tanstack/react-query properly
- Test cache manipulation methods
- Verify query invalidation patterns
- Test optimistic updates and rollbacks
- Ensure proper TypeScript types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All query client utilities have test coverage
- [ ] Cache invalidation logic is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Optimistic updates and rollbacks work correctly
- [ ] Tests pass locally with `npm test`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors with `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Coverage report shows 60%+ for query-client module

## Notes
This is a good starting point as it's one of the simpler modules to test and doesn't have complex mocking requirements like the API client.
