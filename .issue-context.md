## Description
Split from PR #10 to make the changes more manageable. This issue focuses on adding comprehensive test coverage for API hooks and fixing TypeScript generic syntax issues.

## Scope
- Extend tests in `src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-api.test.tsx`
- File additions: ~745 lines of new tests
- Fix TypeScript errors in test-utils.tsx

## Hooks to Test
### Document Hooks
- useDocuments, useDocument
- useDocumentUpload, useDocumentProcess
- useDocumentDelete

### Course Hooks  
- useCourses, useCourse
- useCourseCreate, useCourseUpdate
- useCourseDelete, useCourseGenerate
- useCourseExport

### Job & Generation Hooks
- useJobStatus, useJobCancel
- useGenerateCourse, useGenerateContent

### Other Hooks
- useAuth (login, register, logout)
- useHealth

## Technical Requirements
### TypeScript Fixes
- Fix generic syntax in test-utils.tsx line 187: `<T>` â†’ `<T,>` or function declaration
- Fix all related TypeScript errors in use-api.test.tsx
- Ensure proper JSX/TSX compatibility

### Testing Requirements
- Use React Testing Library with renderHook
- Mock API calls with MSW
- Test loading, error, and success states
- Test mutation side effects and cache updates
- Test error handling and retry logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API hooks have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] TypeScript errors are resolved
- [ ] Tests pass locally with `npm test`
- [ ] No errors with `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Proper cleanup in test lifecycle
- [ ] Cache invalidation is tested for mutations

## Priority
This should be done after the simpler modules (query-client) to learn from their patterns.
