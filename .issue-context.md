## Description
Split from PR #10 to make the changes more manageable. This issue focuses on adding comprehensive test coverage for the WebSocket client module.

## Scope
- Add tests for `src/lib/websocket/client.ts`
- Target coverage: 60%+ (currently 0%)
- File: `src/lib/websocket/__tests__/client.test.ts` (~800 lines)

## Test Coverage Areas
- Connection lifecycle testing
- Auto-reconnection and exponential backoff
- Offline queue management  
- Event subscriptions and room management
- Authentication token handling
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Technical Requirements
- Fix TypeScript generic syntax issues
- Properly mock Socket.io client
- Use existing test patterns from codebase
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All WebSocket client methods have test coverage
- [ ] Tests pass locally with `npm test`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors with `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Coverage report shows 60%+ for websocket module
