## Type
Enhancement

## Description
Add comprehensive test coverage for authentication pages which currently have 0% coverage. This is part of splitting issue #5 into smaller, more manageable PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Register page tests fully passing (23 tests)
- [ ] Forgot password page tests fully passing (19 tests)
- [ ] All tests follow established patterns from TESTING_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Tests cover rendering, validation, user interactions, and accessibility
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in test files

## Technical Details
- Fix auth store mocking issues in remaining auth tests
- Update test assertions to work with default null user from setup.tsx
- Follow the pattern established in the login page tests
- Ensure all form validations and error states are tested
