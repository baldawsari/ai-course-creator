function App() {
  return (
    <CollaborationProvider
      courseId="your-course-id"
      showStatusBar
      showNotifications
      autoSync
    >
      <YourAppContent />
    </CollaborationProvider>
  )
}
```

2. **Use collaborative editing:**

```tsx
import { CollaborativeEditor } from '@/components/features/collaboration'

function Editor() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState('')
  
  return (
    <CollaborativeEditor
      courseId="course-id"
      sessionId="session-id"
      content={content}
      onChange={setContent}
      showPresence
      showConflicts
    />
  )
}
```

3. **Add notifications:**

```tsx
import { NotificationCenter } from '@/components/features/collaboration'

function Header() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
      <NotificationCenter />
      {/* Other header content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

4. **Include activity feed:**

```tsx
import { ActivityFeed } from '@/components/features/collaboration'

function Sidebar() {
  return (
    <ActivityFeed

      compact
      maxItems={20}
      showFilters
    />
  )
}
```

} from '@/components/features/collaboration'

function CustomComponent() {
  const { isConnected, client } = useWebSocket()
  const { users, userPresence } = useCourseCollaboration('course-id')
  const { notifications, unreadCount } = useRealtimeNotifications()
  
  // Custom collaboration logic
}
```
