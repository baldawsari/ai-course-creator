# Issue #16: Add Test Coverage for Auth Pages

## 📋 Issue Details
- **Issue**: #16
- **Title**: Add test coverage for auth pages (login, register, forgot-password)
- **Branch**: issue-16-login-register-test
- **PR**: https://github.com/baldawsari/ai-course-creator/pull/22

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login page tests fully passing (21 tests)
- [ ] Register page tests fully passing (23 tests)
- [ ] Forgot password page tests fully passing (19 tests)
- [x] All tests follow established patterns from TESTING_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md
- [x] Tests cover rendering, validation, user interactions, and accessibility
- [x] No TypeScript errors in test files

## 📊 Current Status

### Test Files Created
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/(auth)/__tests__/login.test.tsx` (425 lines)
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/(auth)/__tests__/register.test.tsx` (492 lines)
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/(auth)/__tests__/forgot-password.test.tsx` (392 lines)

### Test Results
```
Total: 71 tests across 3 files (31 passing - 44% coverage)
- Login: 14/23 passing (61%) ⚠️
- Register: ~8/23 passing (estimated 35%) ⚠️
- Forgot Password: ~9/19 passing (estimated 47%) ⚠️
```

### Progress Updates
- ✅ Fixed framer-motion mocking - now supports all motion elements
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint URLs (removed /api prefix)
- ✅ Fixed auth store mocking to use shared mockAuthStore
- ✅ Updated test expectations to match actual API responses
- ⚠️ Remaining issues: async operations timing out, some UI elements not found

## 🔧 Work Completed

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Added MSW server to global test setup (`src/__tests__/setup.tsx`)
- ✅ Created auth store mock (attempted multiple approaches)
- ✅ Fixed router mocking issues
- ✅ Added toast mock to prevent test errors

### 2. Test Coverage Added

#### Login Page (21 tests)
- Rendering tests (5)
- Form validation tests (5)
- Form interaction tests (3)
- Form submission tests (5)
- Mobile responsiveness tests (2)
- Accessibility tests (3)

#### Register Page (23 tests)
- Multi-step form rendering (6)
- Step navigation (3)
- Form validation per step (6)
- Registration flow (4)
- Mobile optimization (2)
- Accessibility (2)

#### Forgot Password Page (19 tests)
- Form rendering (7)
- Form submission (6)
- Success/error states (4)
- Accessibility (2)

### 3. Issues Encountered & Fixed
- ❌ `jest.mocked` not working with Next.js setup
- ✅ Fixed by using manual mocking approach
- ❌ Auth store mock conflicts with test-utils
- ✅ Resolved by using existing mockAuthStore from test-utils
- ❌ MSW server not starting
- ✅ Added server.listen() to setup.tsx

## 🐛 Current Issues

### 1. Login/Register Tests Failing
**Error**: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)"
**Cause**: Component import/rendering issues, likely framer-motion
**Status**: Need to fix

### 2. Forgot Password Async Tests
**Error**: Tests timing out after 5 seconds
**Cause**: Async operations not resolving properly
**Tests affected**: 5 tests related to API calls

### 3. Component Dependencies
- Framer-motion animations causing rendering issues
- May need to update motion mock in setup.tsx

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Fix framer-motion mocking to resolve component rendering
2. Debug async test timeouts in forgot-password
3. Ensure all 71 tests pass
4. Update PR with passing tests
